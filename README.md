# Search for Fast Radio Bursts with the Open Glider Network.

## Introduction
The concept is inspired by the paper published on arXiv.org https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01475 - reading it is already a very good introduction.

The Open Glider Network (OGN0 is a network of ground receivers tuned to (Europe and Africa) the 868MHz ISM band.
This network should be sensitive enough to detect Fast Radio Bursts coming from our Galaxy.

This project attempts to perform such a search; at this moment data from about 20 OGN ground receivers is being collected and stored for futher analysis.
